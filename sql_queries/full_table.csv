I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you 
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we'rе goin' through it 
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you 
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us 
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you 
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
I'm findin' ways to stay concentrated on what I gotta do
But, baby boy, it's so hard 'round you
And yes, I'm blamin' you
And you know I can't fake it, now or never
And you insinuatin' that you think we might be better
Better me and you
Yeah, I know you do
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect 
And I know you deserve it

We were good, we were gold

Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me 
I won't have to hold my breath
Till you get down on one knee 
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough 
Did you ever feel me?
Would you ever picture us? 
Every time I pull my hair
Well, it's only out of fear 
That you'll find me ugly
And one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying?
It was nеver even lovе 
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough? 
The-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy

He say that I'm good enough, grabbin' my duh-duh-duh
Thinkin' 'bout shit that I shouldn't've 
So I tell him there's one of me, he makin' fun of me 
His girl is a bum to me 
Like that boy is a cap
Sayin' he home, but I know where he at, like
Bet he blowin' her back
Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that it's fat 
And it been what it been 
Callin' his phone like, ""Yo, send me a pin""
Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on 
But when he hit me I'm not gon' respond 
But I don't sleep enough without you
And I can't eat enough without you

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night

Be at peace with the things you can't change 
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
I don't wanna feel how I did last night

Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor 'cah fuck these feelings

La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona te miente

Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste  y te conseguiste nueva novia 
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía me está' viendo toa' la historia' 
Bebé, ¿qué fue?, ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? 
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? Si sabes que yo errores no repito 
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito
Verte con la nueva me dolió 
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte 
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte 
'Toy más dura dicen los reporte'
Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota 
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me 
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour 
You slow down time
In your golden hour 
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?
For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life

This girl make me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feelin' depressed and stuff
Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us

You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short
Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before
Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car

Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny 
You handle it beautifully 
All this shit is new to me 
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me 
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see 
Is a one-night or a wife
I find it dizzying 
They're bringing up my history 
But you weren't even listening 
I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say

Déjate ver, dime si hoy vas pa' la calle, bebé
'Toy en el case pensándote otra vez
Quiero pichear, pero me salió al revés
Mi amor, a las dos paso por ti, ve arreglándote
Hoy to' corre por la mía, relájate
Prometí que no iba a hacerte daño
Así me sienta' extraño, soy el que se quedó en tu piel
Y mientras  me calientas 
Veo todo lo quе nunca me cuentas 
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
Dale hasta abajo que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde', eh-eh
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche, eh-eh
Y mientras  me calientas 
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas 
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
E-E-El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
Tú ya-Tú ya sabe' lo que quiero, baby, fluya
A ti mucha' te envidian, pero tú estás en la tuya
Mamá, un baile privado pa'l que no sepa na'
Y ya bajamo' tensión
Vine a buscarte, tú sabes la intención
Perreamo' esta canción
Después me dice', ma, que te pareció
Y yo no sé, pero me dio contigo
Estaba ruteando, pensándote y salí del caserío
Quiero probarte, que sea esta noche
Bebé, me traje la corta por si me meto en un lío

Los peine' están full, la moto full de gasoli
Gafitas Oakley, machea con la white tee
Me dice ""FERXXO"", qué rico se lo metí
Esa noche 'e jangueo, de fumeteo
Contigo to' los partie' son de perreo
Bebé, cuando te veo, yo te leo
Tú te pierde', mami, yo te rastreo, oh
Baby, me la paso joseando, no tengo de otra
Hagamo' que esta noche sea larga, bebé, porque la vida e' muy corta
Dale hasta abajo, que ese culo responde

Two fingers, set one down on my toes ten
Fueled out with my boobs out, put a cork in it
Love it when you be crying out when I'm corseted
I don't think you gon' make it, do not let me start raging
I'm losing my patience, this ain't staying in Vеgas 
There's more sidеs to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sitting courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sitting first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Could've been what we should've been, but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat
I ain't playing this hide and seek
High school when you finally peaked
Hound dog, come find a treat
I'm a bad bitch, but

I get it, I know you got some other- you wanted
I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks
When I release you in them sheets 
And keep my meaning discreet
Keep the cleaning my gym
And put that Yeezy in your teeth
Let my demons off their leashes
If you even think to speak
I'ma give a whole new meaning
When you said you living a dream
We can keep that- asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your G's
Count them sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
Talking 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R.I.P.

Ey
Tití me preguntó si tengo mucha' novia', mucha' novia'
Hoy tengo a una, mañana otra, ey, pero no hay boda
Tití me preguntó si tengo mucha' novia', je, mucha' novia'
Hoy tengo a una, mañana otra
Me la' vo'a llevar a to'a pa' un VIP, un VIP, ey
Saluden a Tití
Vamo' a tirarno' un selfie, say ""cheese"", ey
Que sonrían las que ya les metí
En un VIP,  un VIP, ey
Saluden a Tití
Vamo' a tirarno' un selfie, say ""cheese""
Que sonrían las que ya se olvidaron de mí
Me gustan mucho las Gabriela
Las Patricia, las Nicole, las Sofía
Mi primera novia en kinder, María
Y mi primer amor se llamaba Thalía
Tengo una colombiana que mе escribe to' los día'
Y una mexicana quе ni yo sabía
Otra en San Antonio que me quiere todavía
Y las de PR que todita' son mía'
Una dominicana que es uva bombón
Uva, uva bombón
La de Barcelona que vino en avión
Y dice que mi bicho está cabrón
Yo dejo que jueguen con mi corazón
Quisiera mudarme con toda' pa' una mansión
El día que me case te envío la invitación
Muchacho, deja eso, ey

Búscate una mujer seria pa' ti
Chacho 'el diablo, coño
Yo quisiera enamorarme
Pero no puedo, pero no puedo, eh, eh

Sorry, yo no confío, yo no confío
Nah, ni en mí mismo confío
Si quiere' quedarte hoy que hace frío
Y mañana te va', nah
Muchas quieren mi baby gravy
Quieren tener mi primogénito, ey
Y llevarse el crédito
Ya me aburrí, hoy quiero un totito inédito, je
Uno nuevo, uno nuevo, uno nuevo, uno nuevo 
Hazle caso a tu amiga, ella tiene razón
Yo vo'a romperte el corazón, vo'a romperte el corazón
Ey, no te enamore' de mí

Sorry, yo soy así
Ya no quiero ser así, no
